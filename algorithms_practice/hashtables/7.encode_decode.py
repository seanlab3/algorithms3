'''
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl 
and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode 
algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be 
decoded to the original URL.
