'''
Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) 
such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all 
in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

Example:

Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
