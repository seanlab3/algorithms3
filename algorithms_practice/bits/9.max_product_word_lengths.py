'''
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words 
do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two 
words exist, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16 
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
Example 2:

Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
Example 3:

Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0 
Explanation: No such pair of words.
