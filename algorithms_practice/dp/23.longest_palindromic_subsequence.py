'''
Longest Pallindromic Subsequence
Given a strings A. Find the common pallindromic sequence ( A sequence which 
does not need to be contiguous and is a pallindrome), which is common in itself 
You need to return the length of such longest common subsequence. NOTE:
Your code will be run on multiple test cases (<=10). Try to come up with an 
optimised solution.
CONSTRAINTS
1 <= Length of A, B <= 10^3 + 5
EXAMPLE INPUT
A : "bebeeed"
EXAMPLE OUTPUT
4
EXPLANATION
The longest common pallindromic subsequence is "eeee", which has a length of 4
