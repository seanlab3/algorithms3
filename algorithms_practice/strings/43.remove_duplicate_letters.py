'''
Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that 
every letter appear once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest 
in lexicographical order among all possible results.

Example 1:

Input: "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
Example 2:

Input: "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
