'''
Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each 
word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial
 word order.

Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and 
there will not be any extra space in the string.

# def reverse_words(words):
#     words = words.split()
#     for i in range(len(words)):
#         words[i] = words[i][::-1]
#     return ' '.join(words)
from algorithms3.strings import reverse_words_III
a="Let's take LeetCode contest"

print(reverse_words_III.reverse_words(a))
