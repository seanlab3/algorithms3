'''
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a 
substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a 
substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
